          About Us
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl select-none mb-6">
          We are a dedicated team of professionals from the Ismaili community,
          united by our shared experiences and a commitment to giving back. Some
          of us have been international students, navigating the complexities of
          studying in new countries, while others have pursued education and
          careers locally. We&apos;ve all faced challenges along the wayâ€”whether
          moving to different countries, working hard to secure our dream jobs,
          or figuring out our own paths. Now, our goal is to help young
          individuals of our community by offering guidance and mentorship
          during the critical stages of their lives. We aim to provide clarity
          and direction, empowering them to make informed decisions about their
          education and career journeys.
